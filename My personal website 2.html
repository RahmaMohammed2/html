    <p> 
        I was a girl in the village doing alright
        Then I became a princess overnight
        Now I gotta figure out how to do it right
        So much to learn and see
        Up in the castle with my new family
        In a school that's just for royalty
        A whole enchanted world is waiting for me
        I'm so excited to be.
